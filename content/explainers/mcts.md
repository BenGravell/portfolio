*Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)* is a lookahead planning algorithm that builds a search tree incrementally by simulating future trajectories and backing up value estimates. *Upper Confidence Tree (UCT)* is the dominant variant, using a principled exploration bonus to balance exploiting promising branches versus exploring uncertain ones.

MCTS saw great success when applied towards playing the board game "Go" with the Alpha series of models (AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero, and AlphaZero), ultimately achieving superhuman performance through pure self-play by combining MCTS with neural networks serving as policy and value functions.
